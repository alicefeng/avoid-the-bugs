Avoid the Bugs!
===============================

A remix of the classic arcade game Frogger.

## How Do I Play?

The objective of this game is simple: you need to cross the road and make it safely to the water without running into any of the bugs.

You can move the player up, down, left or right by using the arrow keys.

Try to avoid the bugs!  If you run into any of them, you will lose and the game will reset.  You win the game by making it safely to the water.
